I am Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Economic Studies ([IES](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/)) of Charles University in Prague. 

My primary research interests lie in understanding the role of expectations and uncertainty in household decision-making and the broader economy. Further, I explore the transition channels of household-level uncertainty through DSGE models with uncertainty. 

In the broad sense, my interests extent to uncertainty, inequality, and heterogeneity.
